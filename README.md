 **Analyze the Effect of Multipath Fading in an Antenna System for Wireless Communication**

##📝 Project Description
This project focuses on simulating and analyzing the impact of multipath fading in wireless communication systems using MATLAB. We modeled an OFDM-based WLAN system and applied Rayleigh fading and Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) to observe signal degradation. The goal is to understand how real-world propagation conditions affect signal quality in wireless channels.

###🚀 What the Application Does
Simulates a wireless OFDM signal using MATLAB's WLAN Toolbox.
Applies Rayleigh fading to model multipath effects.
Adds AWGN to replicate channel noise.

##Visualizes:
Time-domain waveform
Spectrum before and after fading
Constellation diagram to observe signal distortion

##💡 Why We Used These Technologies
Technology / Toolbox	Reason
MATLAB WLAN Toolbox	To simulate 802.11ac OFDM signals efficiently
Communications Toolbox	For modeling Rayleigh fading and AWGN noise
DSP System Toolbox	To visualize time and frequency domain data using Time Scope and Spectrum Analyzer
Constellation Diagram	To inspect modulation distortion due to fading

These tools offer an end-to-end simulation environment with visual insights into wireless communication behavior.

##🧩 Challenges Faced
Modeling realistic multipath environments using Rayleigh channels with accurate delay/gain values.
Matching sample rates across various MATLAB system blocks to avoid runtime errors.
Ensuring proper visualization timing to capture degraded vs. original signals accurately.
No MATLAB license/toolbox for patch antenna simulation — so antenna design was described conceptually only.

##🔮 Features to Implement in the Future
Include simulation of 2.4 GHz patch antenna using the Antenna Toolbox.
Add performance metrics like BER (Bit Error Rate) and SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio).
Create a GUI or App Designer interface to let users input their own fading parameters.
Export simulation data for training machine learning models.

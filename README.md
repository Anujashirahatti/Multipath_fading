### 📝 Project Description  
This is a **real-world industry-level project** focused on simulating and analyzing the **impact of multipath fading** in wireless communication systems using **MATLAB**.  
We modeled an **OFDM-based WLAN system** and applied **Rayleigh fading** and **Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)** to observe signal degradation.  
The goal is to understand how real-world propagation conditions affect signal quality in wireless channels, similar to scenarios encountered in actual telecommunication networks.

### 🧩 Challenges Faced  
- Modeling realistic multipath environments using Rayleigh channels with accurate delay/gain values.  
- Matching sample rates across various MATLAB system blocks to avoid runtime errors.  
- Ensuring proper visualization timing to capture degraded vs. original signals accurately.  
- No MATLAB license/toolbox for patch antenna simulation — so antenna design was described conceptually only.

### 🔮 Features to Implement in the Future  
- 📡 Include simulation of 2.4 GHz patch antenna using the Antenna Toolbox.  
- 📉 Add performance metrics like **BER (Bit Error Rate)** and **SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**.  
- 🖥 Create a **GUI or App Designer interface** to let users input their own fading parameters.  
- 📤 Export simulation data for training machine learning models.
